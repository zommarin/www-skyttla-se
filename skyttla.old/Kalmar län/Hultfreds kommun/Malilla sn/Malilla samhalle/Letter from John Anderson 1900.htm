<p>Beloved father and mother</p>
<p>Feel hood!</p>
<p>Now I will take the liberty for a while to talk to my beloved parents. First 
I will mention that we all are in good health up to now, and hope that these 
lines will meet you in the good gift of health. It is a long time since I heard 
from you. I wrote to my brother Axel last Summer but have got no answer, so I 
hope that you have not forgot me. Something about the harvest here i Nebraska 
this year. We have had it very dry this Summer so we have got a low harvest this 
year, but God bless we have got enough not to suffer any trouble. We have enough 
of everything of what we need to eat and to dress ourselves. We have 75 pigs and 
we have got corn so we can have them until February when we can sell them if 
they are not so big we will still make a profit. From wheat we did not get a 
full harvest, and from oats about a fourth. Potatoes we got what we need, corn a 
fourth of full harvest. We have fed up 10 calves this year, 3 colts and 75 pigs, 
and we have 14 horses incl small and grown up, and 20 cattle, 75 pigs. The 
prices are good for all. Horses, cattle and pigs are very expensive. I now shall 
end this letter with a dear greeting from us all to the beloved parents and 
brothers and sisters, yes, Hanna and the children send a special greeting to 
grandpa and grandma, me too, with all regards your humble son</p>
<p>Johan Alfred Anderson.</p>

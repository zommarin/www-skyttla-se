<p>Translation:</p>
<p>Holdrege Neb September 15 /99</p>
<p>Beloved Parents and Brothers and Sisters.</p>
<p>Have a fine life and be always happy are our heartly wishes to you all.</p>
<p>First of all I will tell you that we here are in good health and feel well, 
and we hope that these few lines will meet you with the same gift, which is a 
great gift to thank God for. I got brother Axel´s letter on the 9th this month 
and the money on the 13th. It was on Dollar 269 and 35 cent which I will thank 
you so very much for. Beloved parents, I can not with words express my 
thankfulness to You, but a heartily felt Thanks och God might bless you.</p>
<p>As I can see in my brother Axel´s letter, you have had dry and warm weather 
this year, We have had very warm and dry [weather], and it has been a very bad 
harvest of rye and wheat. The harvest has been a third[?]. Oats and corn has 
given a half&nbsp; or less harvest, but potatoes has given a full harvest.</p>
<p>The cattles are very expensive this Fall, they have not been as expensive in 
15 years. The horses are more expensive this year than last. I will sell a pair 
coming Spring because I will have too many then, and I believe I get a better 
price coming Spring that what I can get now.</p>
<p>I will stop writing now with a thousand greetings from us to all of you.</p>
<p>Sincerely from your humble son<br>
John A. Anderson</p>
